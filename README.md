Creating the models from xsd files
====================================
need a path without spaces... thus copy some of the libs and xsd files into a different location

set JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_73
D:\jaxb\eclipselink\bin>jaxb-compiler.cmd BPMN20.xsd

this creates the relevant sources
copy them into the right place.
